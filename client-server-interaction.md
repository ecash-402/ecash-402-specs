# Client-Server Interaction Patterns

## Overview

The client-server interaction system enables intelligent decision-making through comprehensive model and pricing queries, allowing clients to make cost-effective choices based on real-time server data while maintaining efficient communication patterns.

## Model Discovery and Selection Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Smart Client
    participant S as Dynamic Server
    participant PE as Pricing Engine
    participant PM as Performance Monitor

    Note over C: Client needs to select optimal model
    C->>S: Query available models
    S-->>C: Model list with specifications

    Note over S: Calculate dynamic pricing
    S->>S: Request pricing for selected models

    Note over C: Client analyzes cost-effectiveness
    C->>C: Compare models by cost/performance
    C->>S: Select optimal model for request
```

### Three-Stage Selection Process

**1. Model Discovery**

- Query server for available models with detailed specifications
- Receive capabilities, context lengths, model types

**2. Pricing Analysis**

- Request current costs per million tokens
- Request pricing updates
- Compare costs across different model options and providers

**3. Selection Optimization**

- Analyze cost-effectiveness based on specific use case requirements
- Integrate quality metrics and performance ratings
- Balance cost optimization with performance standards

### Smart Decision Features

**Multi-factor Analysis**: Balances cost, performance, quality, and availability

**Request Optimization**:

- **Timing Optimization**: Schedules requests during lower-cost periods
- **Model Switching**: Dynamically selects based on current conditions
- **Load Distribution**: Spreads requests across multiple providers

**Performance Monitoring**:

- Real-time cost tracking and budget management
- Success rate monitoring with retry logic

## Server Capabilities

### Dynamic Model Management

- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous model catalog and capability updates
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamic computational resource distribution
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent request distribution and queue optimization
- **Failover Handling**: Automatic handling of model or resource failures

### Intelligent Recommendations

- **Performance Optimization**: Recommending models for specific use cases
- **Cost Optimization**: Suggesting cost-effective alternatives

## Communication Protocols

### Efficient Data Exchange

```mermaid

    participant C as Smart Client
    participant S as Dynamic Server

    C->>S: Model query with parameters
    S-->>C: Optimized response

    Note over C,S: Efficient caching reduces<br/>redundant database queries
```

### Protocol Optimizations

- **Response Caching**: Intelligent caching of frequently requested data
- **Streaming Updates**: Real-time pricing, availability, and performance data
- **Batch Requests**: Support for batched queries to reduce overhead

## System Benefits
